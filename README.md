# Data Analysis:
We cleaned, processed, and analyzed WASH datasets using R and Python within Posit Cloud (Jupyter & RStudio) and google colab. The analysis work included data wrangling, statistical summaries, and exploratory techniques to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data. We also implemented a Random Forest model in R to support predictive analysis and evaluate feature importance.
# Data Visualization:
We created various visual outputs to communicate findings effectively. This included  scatter plots and other visual summaries built using Matplotlib in Python and ggplot2 in R. These charts helped highlight key patterns and illustrated important insights from the WASH datasets
# Tools & Libraries Used

Python: Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy

R: ggplot2, tidyverse, caret, randomForest

Environment: Posit Cloud (RStudio & Jupyter)
